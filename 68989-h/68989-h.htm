<p class="drop-cap">
<span class="smcap larger">At</span> 
this great time in the nation’s history, when changes
moral and material are following each other with such
speed that we “know not what a day may bring forth,”
it seems all the more incumbent on us while we live in
the present not to forget the past. Accordingly, the
Committee felt that pictures and drawings of the London of our ancestors
would have exceptional interest, and the present exhibition is the result.
</p>

<p>
The space at our command being limited, we can only show a tithe
of the material still in existence, but, through the kindness of owners,
many fine works are on our walls, with others which, although as
regards craftsmanship they have only average merit, are valuable as
showing noteworthy scenes and buildings of a former day. Among the
number that have not been exhibited before we would mention the
drawings from Windsor which His Majesty the King has been graciously
pleased to lend, also those belonging to Sir Edward Coates—but a
trifling instalment of his unique collection.
</p>

<p>
By way of preface a few words on old London views may not be
thought superfluous. In manuscripts and early printed books pictures or
illustrations which purported to represent London were now and then
produced, but the artists did not attempt to imitate nature with precision,
their feeling for decorative effect being paramount. Indeed, in R. Pynson’s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
edition of the “Cronycle of Englonde” (1510), what is probably the
earliest engraved view which has any claim to represent London, shows no
pretence of accuracy. With an effort of faith we may believe that we are
looking at representations of old St. Paul’s, the Tower, London Bridge,
Ludgate, and the church of the Black Friars, but the design is symbolic
rather than imitative.
</p>

<p>
Illuminations in manuscripts of the previous century in one or two
instances give us clearer topographical hints. A volume of the English
poems of Charles, Duke of Orleans, among the royal manuscripts at the
British Museum, shows the duke, who was captured at the battle of
Agincourt, as a prisoner in the Tower of London, where he was kept for
many years. The river side of the keep has been opened, and he appears
seated within. Portions of the Tower and old London Bridge with its
chapel are well portrayed, while other buildings, although incorrectly
placed, add a little to our knowledge. Another of the royal manuscripts
in the British Museum shows Chaucer’s Canterbury pilgrims starting on
their journey, with London in the background, the most interesting
feature of this topographically being the old city wall, with its bastions
at regular intervals. Something more may be learnt from the engraving
(after a picture at Cowdray, destroyed by fire long ago) of the procession
of Edward VI through London in 1547. The artist, however, is still
not imitating nature directly, but introduces conventional renderings of
the more important buildings with which he was familiar, without
troubling himself much about their relative positions.
</p>

<p>
Two fine representations of Tudor London deserve special mention.
The first of them as regards time is a view of London, not from Suffolk
House as is generally supposed, but from the tower of the church of
St. George the Martyr, Southwark, with Suffolk House, or part of it, in
the foreground. It is a pen drawing, ten feet long or more, and is now
in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Although the various important
buildings are brought somewhat together in order to include them all,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
this view has a look of nature, the style also being free and skilful. The
artist is Anthonie Van den Wyngaerde, now generally held to have been
a Fleming in the train of Philip II. The second Tudor view, which is at
Hatfield House and belongs to the Marquess of Salisbury, is an oil
picture, also by a Flemish artist, Joris Hoefnagel. It was rather poorly
described by George Corner in a paper read before members of the
Surrey Archaeological Society in 1858, and was in the Tudor Exhibition
at the New Gallery in 1890, being then called Horsleydown Fair; but in
all probability it represents a marriage fête by the old church of St. Mary
Magdalen, Bermondsey, which has since been rebuilt excepting the lower
part of the mediaeval tower. The ground between the church and the river
is portrayed with much detail, and the scene is full of life and incident.
The Tower of London appears in the distance. Hoefnagel, born at
Antwerp, was responsible for many beautiful paintings, mostly of the
miniature kind, and drew plans for Braun and Hogenberg’s “Civitates
Orbis Terrarum,” published at Cologne in 1572, among them that representing
London. On this perhaps the plan ascribed to Agas was based;
the alternative being that they both owe their origin in some degree to
a still earlier plan, all trace of which has disappeared.
</p>

<p>
In the seventeenth century pictures of London subjects begin to be
fairly plentiful. Among early ones the curious diptych of old St. Paul’s,
dating from the time of James I and belonging to the Society of
Antiquaries, may be mentioned. Although artless and entirely lacking in
perspective, it contains details which are not to be found elsewhere,
and there is a quaint London view at the back. Later in that century a
series of accurate etchings by Hollar throw much light on the London
of his day. About the same time also a few large and realistic pictures of
London were painted, of which we are able to show two or three examples.
</p>

<p>
Soon after 1720 the charm of London scenes came to be more
generally recognized, and from then onwards her river, her parks, her
streets and public buildings, have been depicted times innumerable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
by some of our most famous artists. Until the latter part of the eighteenth
century oil pictures of scenes on the Thames were plentiful, Samuel
Scott, who was also a marine painter, setting the example. He was a
friend of Hogarth, and together they illustrated the account of that
frolicsome jaunt to the Isle of Sheppey and back in 1732, which is now
in the British Museum. Scott, who was latterly much influenced by
Canaletto, founded more or less of a school, some of the pictures usually
ascribed to him being perhaps by his followers. Canaletto himself paid
us a prolonged visit, and several of his fine London drawings are on our
walls. There is also evidence that he designed two oil pictures here
exhibited (Nos. 69 and 94), which were previously attributed to Scott.
As time went on water-colours by the Sandbys and others gradually
came into vogue. Many years before the date to which this exhibition is
confined, our predecessors began to take an interest not only in river
scenes and great public buildings, but in humbler subjects, such as old
houses, and picturesque nooks and corners threatened with destruction.
Pennant’s “London,” of which there are several splendidly extra illustrated
copies, helped to encourage these varied tastes, so did Wilkinson’s
“Londina Illustrata,” to name only one later publication, and competent
draughtsmen and engravers got something like permanent employment
on work of this kind.
</p>

<p>
We will now say a few words about the great private collections of
London topographical prints, drawings, maps and plans, formed many
years ago, chiefly of material which comes within the period to which we
are limited. Three of these collections are specially famous, and they were
brought together by busy men who died within living memory. These
were Frederick Crace, to whom we owe the many portfolios catalogued
under his name in the Print Room of the British Museum; James Holbert
Wilson, whose collection has unfortunately been dispersed, and John
Edmund Gardner. It is his amazing collection, far larger than all the
rest put together, which has been saved for our interest and instruction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
by Sir Edward Coates, and of which a few examples are here shown.
The late Mr. Gardner who formed it, began when little more than a
boy, by the purchase for five guineas of an extra illustrated Pennant, and
he continued buying steadily throughout a long life. He passed away
December 29th, 1899, at the ripe age of eighty-two, having occupied
himself with his beloved portfolios on that very day. Among his more
important purchases were almost all the original drawings, about two
hundred in number, made for the “Londina Illustrata,” and twenty-eight
folio volumes of sketches by John Carter. Not very many years ago
the late J. P. Emslie, who, with C. J. Richardson and others, carried on
the work of previous generations, told the present writer that he had
just completed his thousandth drawing for the Gardner collection.
</p>

<p>
To conclude. It is now somewhat the habit to speak slightingly of
topographical pictures and drawings, as if there were something unworthy
in copying with correctness the appearance of an interesting
building or an attractive river or street scene. Such work is supposed
to be outside the region of art, as giving no play to the imagination.
But surely “the originality of a subject is in its treatment.” A man
without a touch of the true spirit may paint the most ideal scene and
leave us cold. On the other hand, while many artists of no exceptional
talent, by their honest efforts have left topographical records for which
we are thankful, almost all our great landscape painters have deigned
now and then to depict London, and for those in sympathy with them
they still give something of the thrill of pleasure which they themselves
felt when they put their whole souls into their work.

1550 the nave was made over to the Dutch community in London,

destroyed by the then Marquess of Winchester at the beginning of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>

It was “restored” at a cost of about £12,000.

The St. John family became Lords of the Manor of Battersea in the
early part of the seventeenth century. Henry, Viscount Bolingbroke,
retired to the manor-house when nearing the end of his career, and
died there in 1751. In 1763 the manor was sold to Lord Spencer,
and much of the house is said to have been pulled down not long
afterwards. The remainder was enclosed in ground attached to a
mill built about 1794, and it stands in the premises of the existing
flour mill near the parish church, but is now dilapidated.
</p>

<p class="cat">
This old drawing represents the house much as it was a few
years ago. It contained a panelled room, a good staircase, and
remains of a seventeenth-century plaster ceiling still there in 1920.

Stephen’s Chapel, and the Church of St. John the Evangelist with
its four queer towers finished in 1728. In the distance is Lambeth
Palace. Old Westminster Bridge, designed by the Swiss architect
C. Labelye, was begun in 1738-9 and opened 18 November 1750.

Antonio Canale, the Venetian painter, usually called Canaletto,
visited England in 1746, and remained about two years. During that
time he produced many pictures and drawings, chiefly of London
scenes. An inscription on the back of a picture of the Rotunda at
Ranelagh (Nat. Gal. Cat. 1906, No. 1429) has been thought to
prove that he was here in 1754.

Wenceslaus Hollar, born at Prague, was brought to England
by the Earl of Arundel in 1637, and worked under his patronage for
years. In the Civil War he served under the Marquess of Winchester,
and was taken prisoner at Basing House, but escaped to Antwerp.
He afterwards returned, was appointed designer to the King, and
spent the rest of his life here with an interval when he was sent by
Charles II to Tangiers. A most industrious artist, we owe to him
many fine etchings of London; died in poverty.

On spectator’s right the first important object is York Water-gate
still standing at the end of Buckingham Street, Strand, probably
designed by Inigo Jones in 1626, and executed by Nicholas Stone.
(The design is claimed for the latter in his Account Book.) Behind
it is the house where Samuel Pepys lived with Hewer. No. 14
Buckingham Street is on the site. Next is York Water-tower, a
slender wooden building about seventy feet high, part of the waterworks
established 27 Charles II to supply the West End with Thames
water. They were burnt down and re-erected in 1690. Westminster
Abbey and Westminster Hall are prominent. Westminster Bridge is
unfinished. Lambeth Palace appears in the distance to spectator’s
left. A drawing apparently copied from this is in the print room of
the British Museum.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
almost finished in the spring of 1747, but soon afterwards a pier
settled badly. The two adjoining arches were thus wrecked and had
to be supported by wooden framework, the spandrels, balustrades,

they delayed the opening for years.

Old Somerset House was built by the Protector, brother of Jane
Seymour and maternal uncle of Edward VI, being begun soon after
the death of Henry VIII. During a portion of Mary’s reign it was
assigned to her sister Elizabeth. James I granted it to his Queen,
Anne of Denmark. Charles handed it over to his Queen, Henrietta
Maria, and caused a chapel for Roman Catholics to be added to the
building. This was designed by Inigo Jones and consecrated in
1635, and he did other work there. A picture at Dulwich, engraved
for Wilkinson’s “Londina Illustrata,” shows it before his chapel and
alterations destroyed the uniform character of the building. It can
hardly be from nature, as the artist was Cornelis Bol, who also
portrayed the Great Fire. The present view must have been painted
shortly before its demolition in 1775. An arcaded portion designed
by Inigo Jones, stands out prominently.

It continued to be thus used, and was famous for its fireworks.
Degenerating in character, it was suppressed about the year 1753.
On the site Messrs. Beaufoy established their works; they moved to
South Lambeth when Waterloo Bridge (which runs over part of

In “Notes on Prout and Hunt” by Ruskin for an exhibition in
1879-80, he says: “Hunt learned his business not in spots but in
lines. Compare the sketch of the river-side, No. 124, which is as
powerful in lines as Rembrandt, and the St. Martin’s Church,
No. 123, which is like a bit of Hogarth.” The view is along the
colonnaded west front of the church, and up St. Martin’s Lane, of
which the part here shown no longer exists. The bit of churchyard
with tombstones disappeared on the formation of Duncannon Street.

The first Montague House, Bloomsbury, was destroyed by fire
19 January 1685-6, and the second, here shown, was designed soon
afterwards by a Frenchman, Pierre Puget, or Poughet. The encampment
is on the open space at the back of the mansion. The West
Yorkshire Regiment is represented marching past Dr. John Moore,
Bishop of Bangor, afterwards Bishop of Canterbury. Montague
House had been bought for the British Museum under an Act passed
in 1753. Additions were gradually made, but it was not until 1845
that the old building was entirely demolished.

S. H. Grimm, who painted this watercolour, which is signed

about 1778. He sometimes exhibited at the Royal Academy, and
was employed by the Society of Antiquaries, his work being chiefly
topographical.

The scene is a rural one, with what appear to be an oast-house

Rocque’s map showing the Environs of London (1745) Plow’d Garlick
Hill, afterwards Telegraph Hill. On it stands Aske’s School, belonging
to the Haberdashers’ Company. Much of the rest remained open
until a few years ago; now only a recreation ground has been saved
from the builder. This hill is immediately south of the Turnpike
site, now called New Cross Gate. New Cross was an outlying district
of the parish of Deptford. Evelyn, in his “Diary,” 10 November
1675, mentions going in his coach from Sayes Court to “New
Cross” to accompany Lord Berkeley to Dover.

A careful architectural drawing, signed and dated, wherein some
curious figures known as “the Ragged Regiment” are depicted.
These are effigies of royal personages which were exhibited at their
funerals. By degrees they got into a neglected state. Some years
ago what remained of them was collected together, and the relics
are now in the crypt adjoining the pyx chamber. A paper on
them was published in “Archaeologia,” vol. lx, whence the following
notes are culled identifying a few of the figures. The
number refers to that on the drawing. II is thought to have represented
Katherine of Valois. It is carved out of a single piece of
wood; the dress has been painted bright vermilion. III, Anne of
Denmark. IV, Henry VII, face finely modelled in plaster and
painted, probably by an Italian. V is held to be Elizabeth of York.
VI may have been James I, and VIII Queen Mary I. The fronts of
the reliquary cupboards, here shown, have disappeared, their hinges
remain. John Carter, an enthusiastic admirer of Gothic architecture,
is referred to in our preface.

We are fortunate in exhibiting caricatures of auction sales by
two historic firms, both still flourishing. Sotheby’s began in 1744
with Mr. Samuel Baker, who at first held sales in taverns and other
convenient places. In 1754 he established himself at York Street,
Covent Garden, and in 1767 formed a partnership with Mr. J. Leigh.
In 1778 the firm became Leigh and Sotheby. We need only add that
in 1804 the business was moved to 145 Strand, and in 1818 to
3 Waterloo Bridge, re-named 13 Wellington Street, which was given
up two years ago for more commodious quarters in New Bond Street.

The firm owes its origin to a notable man, James Christie, who

skill of the artist, was long hanging in the “great auction rooms”
on the south side of Pall Mall, where Christie took up his quarters,
next to Schomberg House. It was afterwards at the present address,
No. 8 King Street, St. James’s, to which the firm moved in 1824.

Buckingham House in St. James’s Park was designed by

Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, in 1705. There is an account of it
with elevation in Sir Reginald Blomfield’s book on English renaissance
architecture. It was bought by George III, settled on Queen
Charlotte, and here Dr. Johnson had his famous interview with
the King. The original building was altered and added to from
1825 onwards until it quite disappeared, Buckingham Palace covering
the site.

The Savoy near the Strand was a house or palace built in 1245
by Peter, Earl of Savoy and Richmond, uncle of Eleanor, wife to
Henry III. John, King of France, was imprisoned there after the
battle of Poictiers. When in the hands of John of Gaunt it was burnt
by Wat Tyler and his followers. After this it appears to have been
neglected, till in 1505 Henry VII endowed it as a Hospital of
St. John Baptist for the relief of poor people. Suppressed in 1553,
and re-endowed by Queen Mary Tudor, seventeenth century plans
show an important river frontage. It was maintained as a hospital
until 1702, but Strype in 1720 describes it as being partly a prison; in
another portion was “the King’s printing press for proclamations,”
etc. After gradual decay the last remains of the building were
destroyed in the earlier years of the nineteenth century.

The old Church, of early foundation, had been damaged in the
Great Fire, and was repeatedly altered and patched. It stood more
forward in the street than the present building. When the church
was taken down, about 1830, the projecting clock, with its figures
which struck the hours and quarters, was bought by the then Marquess
of Hertford, and moved to his villa in the Regent’s Park (hence
called St. Dunstan’s), long occupied by the first Lord Aldenham,
where it still remains. The statue of Queen Elizabeth at the east end
of the church came from Ludgate, taken down in 1760, and is now
over the entrance of the present church vestry. On the edge of the
pavement is a porters’ rest. Temple Bar in mid-distance.

As already implied by the titles, there were two Thomas Maltons,
father and son, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish their
work. The father (1726-1801) exhibited London views at the Royal
Academy in 1772 and 1774. He taught perspective. His watercolours,
as a rule, were what were known as “tinted drawings,”
begun in Indian ink. The son (1748-1804) received a premium at
the Royal Society of Arts in 1774, and a gold medal at the Royal
Academy in 1782. In 1792 he published “A Picturesque Tour
through the Cities of London and Westminster containing a hundred
aquatints.” He also exhibited London views at the Royal Academy.

Sadler’s Wells, between the New River Head and St. John
Street Road, Islington, was so called from a spring of mineral water
discovered there by a man named Sadler, who in 1683 opened a
music-room connected with it. In course of time rope dancing,
tumbling, pantomime, and other entertainments took place there.
About 1790 it became a theatre, being still among fields. The New
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
River flowed by, and water was introduced from it to a large tank
beneath the floor of the stage—used for naval spectacles, etc.
</p>

<p class="cat">
Here in 1832 T. P. Cooke made his first appearance as William
in “Black-Eyed Susan.” The theatre fell into disrepute, but was
revived by Phelps who, 1844-62, made it “the home of the legitimate
drama.” Closed for some years, it was rebuilt in 1879, and for a short
time was under the management of Mrs. Bateman. This picture agrees
with the view of the old house in Wilkinson’s “Londina Illustrata.”

In the foreground is a man seated on a rail, with what looks
like a plan or drawing in his left hand. He turns to the spectator
and, with his right, points in the direction of Spencer House, the
park front of which still remains unaltered. This figure, in all likelihood,
represents John Vardy, the architect who designed it. The pond
is wrongly named Rosamond’s Pond on the frame. It is mentioned in
the Calendar of Treasury Papers, 9 June 1725, as a “canal or basin
lately made over against Devonshire House,” and was soon afterwards
converted into a reservoir of Chelsea Waterworks. A walk by
it, planted with trees, was called the Queen’s Walk. This reservoir
was enlarged in 1729, and filled up in 1856. The Green Park
Rosamond’s Pond was in the old bed of the Tyburn, much farther
west. A more famous Rosamond’s Pond, in St. James’s Park, disappeared
1770. All three are marked on Rocque’s map of 1746. The
figures scattered about the foreground and reflected in the water
show very well the costume of the period. In the distance is
Buckingham House (see <a href="#Note_48a">No. 48</a>).

This historic mansion was built <i>c.</i> 1605 for Henry Howard,

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
marriage, in 1642, of the daughter of the second Earl of Suffolk with
the tenth Earl of Northumberland. The house was sold under the
compulsory clause of an Act of Parliament in 1873, and Northumberland
Avenue covers the site. The lion on the front is of lead,
and is now at Syon House, Isleworth. The statue of Charles I was
the work of Hubert Le Sœur, and the pedestal, according to Horace
Walpole, was by Grinling Gibbons, but it is now generally assigned
to Joshua Marshall, master mason. On the left appears the famous
old Golden Cross coaching inn, its sign overhanging the roadway.
It was rebuilt in 1832. An engraving of this design, issued in 1753,

William Hogarth was most active in helping the Foundling
Hospital during its early period. In the charter of incorporation he
appears as a “Governor and Guardian.” Immediately afterwards, in
1740, he gave one of his masterpieces, the portrait of Captain Coram,
founder, and within a few years the “March to Finchley,” and other
pictures. In 1746 various painters were induced through his influence
to present examples of their work; among them were F. Hayman,
S. Scott, R. Wilson, and T. Gainsborough, and all were elected
Governors excepting the last-named, then a mere lad, who, after
some years’ work in London, had lately returned to Norfolk. As
time went on further help of this kind was forthcoming, crowds
flocked to see the paintings, and the success of such informal exhibitions
prepared the way for the foundation of the Royal Academy.

The building here shown was designed by Theodore Jacobsen,
who came of a family long connected with the Steelyard, and whose
portrait was painted by Hudson.

An interesting example of Gainsborough’s early work. It is
astonishing that when he presented it (in the year of his marriage)
he was only nineteen, but the authorities of the Foundling Hospital
have no doubt that it was given by him in 1746. The scene depicted
at the Charterhouse is the “Terrace,” a paved walk resting on the
arcade built with it by the Duke of Norfolk, 1565-1571, as a double
ambulatory to his tennis court. The terrace overlooks (to spectator’s
left) the site of the great cloister of the ancient monastery, afterwards
the Duke’s garden, then the “Upper Green” or match-ground of
the school, and now the Merchant Taylors’ playground. The tower
with light shining on it is the chapel tower.

The church of St. Botolph, Aldgate, was rebuilt in 1744, from
the designs of George Dance the elder. In 1710 Sir John Cass,
alderman, had presented this school near the church with shops and
a vault beneath, for the benefit of the ward, and he afterwards left
property for educational purposes, which has become of great value.
About 1750 a lead statue of him, modelled by Roubiliac, was placed
in front of the building. In 1762 the school was moved into a house
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
in Church Row, the original building being used for other purposes,
but this statue and statuettes of a schoolboy and a schoolgirl remained
in their niches as here shown. The building was not destroyed
until many years afterwards. Here one sees that in 1815 part of it
was a watch-house. Most of the site has been absorbed by a widening
of Houndsditch. The statue of Sir John is now in the modern
building known as the Cass Foundation, Jewry Street. The drawing
was done for Wilkinson’s “Londina Illustrata,” but does not appear
in that publication.

from Three Crane Stairs to Westminster, which until the adoption
of the new style in 1752 took place on 29 October (the day after
the feast of SS. Simon and Jude) and was the precursor of the present
Lord Mayor’s Show. A gay scene and evidently a noisy one,
the river crowded with state barges belonging to the Corporation and

The view was painted from what is now called Haverstock Hill,
looking towards London, St. Paul’s Cathedral in the distance. There
is a mezzotint of it by David Lucas. To the small house on the right
Steele retired during the summer of 1712. In a letter to Pope dated
1 June of that year he says: “I am at a solitude, an house between
Hampstead and London wherein Sir Charles Sedley died.” Isaac
Reed, editor of Shakespeare, in his edition of Baker’s “Biographia
Dramatica,” says: “part of the building remains.” In 1855-56 it
was a dairy, faced by the “Load of Hay” public-house, here shown
with Georgian buildings next to it. In one of these, then a dame’s
school, George Grossmith, second of that name, was a pupil. Afterwards
Steele’s cottage was divided into two tenements. According to
F. Baines (“History of Hampstead,” 1890), they were pulled down
in 1867. Steele’s Road covers the site.

The painter, David Turner, exhibited occasionally at the Free
Society and the Royal Academy, beginning in 1782; his pictures
were small, their subjects for the most part being from London and
the Thames. It is said that his name does not appear after 1801, but
a view by him, lately sold at Christie’s, was catalogued as representing
Lord Nelson’s funeral procession on the river.

medallions of fine Italian workmanship. It stood originally
“thwart the high streete” from Charing Cross to Westminster, and
was demolished to make room for Parliament Street in 1759. The
material was moved to Windsor, the then Duke of Cumberland,
ranger of the park and forest there, intending to re-erect it. A

View of old London Bridge, of City of London, and part of
Southwark, before the Great Fire. In foreground, beginning on west
or left side, the following playhouses are shown in their order: the
Swan, destroyed about 1633, the Hope or Bear Garden, and the
second Globe. The turreted building below the Swan was the old
Manor House of Paris Garden. In the reign of Charles I it got a
bad reputation, and was called Holland’s Leaguer from a woman
who occupied it. The next important building is the hall of the
Bishop of Winchester’s house. Then St. Saviour’s, originally church
of Priory of St. Mary Overy, and now Southwark Cathedral. Passing
bridge, on right, is the church of St. Olave, Tooley Street, replaced
by present structure (lately closed) in 1737-39. On Middlesex side,
old St. Paul’s has lost its spire, fatally injured by lightning in 1561.
</p>

<p class="cat">
There is no space to describe bridge in detail. Before removal of
houses under Act of Parliament 1756, it was most picturesque, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
with its many arches, several blocked by mills and waterworks, it
checked flow of water, hence freezing of Thames above bridge, frost
fairs, and danger of passing through in boat, or “shooting the
bridge.” On central pier, projecting to east, was chapel of St. Thomas-à-Becket,
with crypt beneath. In foreground is Southwark gatehouse
(afterwards rebuilt), with heads of traitors above parapet, a
display originally over building farther north, destroyed in 1577.

This picture is clearly not contemporary. It looks like eighteenth
century work, founded on an earlier painting, or on such engraved

Dates from soon after the Restoration. In the foreground to
right is York Water-gate, in mid-distance is the Banqueting Hall.
Next to that the louvred stone building is undoubtedly the great
Hall, Whitehall, also visible in <a href="#Note_89">No. 89</a>. It was about 100 feet long
by 45 feet. Here several of Shakespeare’s plays were acted before
Queen Elizabeth; destroyed in fire of 1697, Horse Guards Avenue
covers most of the site. Below Westminster Abbey, and projecting
into river, is the public landing stage called Whitehall Stairs, with
boats attached to it. The site of this is immediately east of the
present Horse Guards Avenue. Beyond, but at first glance appearing
to be part of same structure, are Privy Stairs, with covered passage.
St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster Hall, and St. Stephen’s Chapel
are grouped together. To extreme left is Lambeth Palace.

The Stocks Market was established in 1282, “where some time
had stood a pair of stocks for punishment of offenders.” It was for
sale of meat and fish until the Great Fire, afterwards a market for fruit
and vegetables. Of the equestrian statue here shown, Pennant in his
“London” gives the following account: it was “erected in honour
of Charles II by his most loyal subject Sir Robert Viner, lord mayor.
Fortunately his lordship discovered one (made at Leghorn) of John
Sobieski trampling on a Turk. The good Knight caused some
alterations to be made, christened the Polish monarch by the name
of Charles, and bestowed on the turbaned Turk that of Oliver Cromwell.”
Horace Walpole says the statue “came over unfinished, and
a head was added by Latham.” Stocks Market was removed in
1737 to clear ground for the present Mansion House. The statue
lay neglected until 1779, and was then given to Mr. Robert Vyner,
descendant of the Lord Mayor. He set it up in Gautby Park,
Lincolnshire, and in 1883 it migrated to Newby Hall, Ripon, the
home of the last Mr. Robert Vyner, who died in 1915.

The picture is pleasantly lighted by the gay costumes of those

This picture represents much the same subject as <a href="#Note_89">No. 89</a>, though
it takes in less ground to the north or left, but from variations in
buildings is evidently some years earlier. The Banqueting House
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
appears, and near it on right the Holbein Gate is partly visible.
Figures are emerging from a great staircase which communicated
with a passage over this gate. In an article by the late Sir Reginald
Palgrave, K.C.B., we are told (on the authority of the Sydney
papers) that Philip, 4th Earl of Pembroke, on the day of Charles I’s
execution, “out of his chamber” (in the Cockpit part of Whitehall)
“looked upon the King as he went up those stairs from the Park to
the gallery on the way to the place of his death.” Hard by, to left
of staircase, is a doorway to passage through the Tiltyard. To right
of staircase is a long gallery dating from Henry VIII’s time. Farther
to right is a two-storied building which appears in Fisher’s plan as
part of the Duke of Albemarle’s lodgings. Vertue’s copy of this plan
is dated 1680, but Mr. Spiers gave good reasons for believing that it
was drawn before 1670.
</p>

<p class="cat">
The battlemented structure behind, with buttresses, mullioned
windows, and turrets at the angles (mentioned in <a href="#Note_89">note on No. 89</a>),
was to north of passage from Whitehall to the Cockpit, now known
as Treasury Passage. In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for 1816 it
is described as part of the palace built by Cardinal Wolsey, and
other writers have called it “Wolsey’s Treasury.” Contemporary
evidence, however, is lacking to prove that any part of Wolsey’s
“York Place” stood west of the thoroughfare that led from Charing
Cross, the land on the Park side having apparently been conveyed to
Henry VIII by the Abbot of Westminster in 1532. The material of
this important building was brick and stone. Its external character
and the ground plan suggest a hall, but whatever its origin it was
undoubtedly used as a tennis court by Henry VIII. Being perhaps
of inconvenient shape for the later developments of the game, and
Charles II having built himself a tennis court farther south, floors
were inserted in 1664, and it became the Duke of Monmouth’s
lodging. What remained of it in the early nineteenth century was
finally swept away to make room for Soane’s Council Office as
completed by Barry.
</p>

<p class="cat">
The next building in front is the Tudor Cockpit, with its octagonal
roof still intact. For years it had not served its original purpose,
but gave the name to a group of lodgings in which it was evidently
included. The Earl of Pembroke, as we have pointed out, was living
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
there at the time of the execution of Charles I, after which Oliver
Cromwell took possession of these lodgings, and it was probably in
the veritable Cockpit that music was performed during his protectorate.
There also plays were acted both in the time of Charles I
and after the Restoration. Just before that event the lodgings were
assigned to George Monck, who became Duke of Albemarle, and in
Fisher’s plan it is marked as part of his lodgings. As mentioned in
describing <a href="#Note_89">No. 89</a>, between the dates of the two pictures this architectural
relic was obliterated by a brick building, which in turn gave
way to Kent’s Treasury. Until about 1806, the word Cockpit was
applied to a famous but elusive political centre included in the
Treasury and more or less on the site of Henry VIII’s building.
Lord Welby thought that the style “Treasury Chambers Cockpit”
was known much later. The passage from Whitehall to the Treasury
is partly lighted on the north side by a large window with mullions
and transom, and on the south there is a two-light window of similar
date. Both are involved externally in Tudor brickwork. On the
ground floor a Tudor doorway survives, and all these must have been
in the casing of the original passage that led to the Cockpit. As
mistakes are frequent on the subject we will add that “Cockpit
Steps” leading from Birdcage Walk into Dartmouth Street have no
historical connection with Whitehall. They adjoined a later Cockpit
surmounted by a cupola, which is marked in a map belonging to
Strype’s Stow 1720, and was taken down in 1816. There was also a
“Royal Cockpit” in Tufton Street, Westminster, described in the
“London Magazine,” November 1822, and in the “Every Night
Book” as late as 1827, which was probably the last in London.
</p>

<p class="cat">
To right of the Tudor Cockpit is a house with tiled roof and
dormer windows, apparently that portion of the Prime Minister’s official
residence adjoining the Treasury and facing the garden, for although
much altered, the points of resemblance are strong. In vol. ii of
the Lond. Top. Soc. “Record,” Mr. Spiers attributed the design of
this building to Wren on account of a ground plan doubtless representing
it, signed by him with the addition of the letters “S<sup>r</sup> G<sup>ll</sup>”
and date 1677; but the present writer is of opinion that it already
existed at the time, and, being on Crown land, that Wren merely
signed the plan as Surveyor General. In the “Record” a plan by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
Sir John Soane is also given, showing his additions and alterations
made in 1825. That part of No. 10 containing the entrance from the
roadway does not belong to the original structure, although they are
linked together by passages. It forms one block with No. 11, and
from the style of the pair they cannot have been built much before
the middle of the eighteenth century, when they appear in views by
J. Maurer, partly occupying the site of the building with gable and
low tower, shown in our picture to the extreme right. On this subject
the late Mr. C. Eyre Pascoe in his volume entitled “No. 10 Downing
Street” was misinformed.
</p>

<p class="cat">
In studying these old pictures it must always be borne in mind
that artists attached small importance to rigid accuracy; while fairly
correct as regards the main buildings they omitted and arranged
with the object of making an agreeable pattern. The trees in
<a href="#Note_89">Nos. 89</a> and 96 differ completely, and in the latter the head of the
ornamental canal, formed soon after the Restoration, has been introduced
out of its place, quite near to the Cockpit. By it are deer, and
it is covered with waterfowl. On the bank is a copy in bronze of the
Borghese statue of a gladiator, executed at Rome by Hubert Le
Sœur, removed by Queen Anne to Hampton Court, and by George IV
to Windsor. On the left King Charles II is taking a walk accompanied
by various dogs and a crowd of courtiers. Near the buildings
a detachment of soldiers in scarlet uniforms marches to the right.
The colour carried at their head agrees with that mentioned by
F. Sandwith, Lancaster Herald 1676-89, as the ensign of the
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Coldstream Guards “from 1670 or thereabout
to 1683.” According to his description the ensign was of “blue
taffeta with a plain white cross, surmounted by a cross of crimson or
a cross of St. George.” Unfortunately on the scale of our engraving
neither the monarch nor this ensign are distinctly visible. There is
an illustration of the scene in Pennant’s “London” from No. 96
or a replica, and a larger one by S. Mazell. Examples of them are
in the Crace Collection, British Museum.

Hendrik Danckerts, or Dankerts, the artist, was born at the
Hague about 1630, studied in Italy, and after his return was invited
to England by Charles II, who employed him to paint pictures of
royal palaces and sea-ports. Walpole speaks of his working in connection 
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
with Hollar. James II had various landscapes by him, and
Samuel Pepys, who calls him “the great landscape painter,” mentions
seeing him in 1668-69 and arranging for views of <i>Whitehall</i>, Hampton
Court, Greenwich, and Windsor, to adorn his dining-room panels.
Danckerts, who was a Roman Catholic, is said to have left England
during the Popish Plot and to have died at Amsterdam soon afterwards.
From what precedes we may be sure that the picture was
painted between 1670 and about 1677, perhaps not much after the
earlier date.

The famous boat builders, of Eton and Oxford, had an establishment

before the formation of the Embankment and the removal of
St. Thomas’s Hospital from High Street, Southwark, to Stangate.
It will be seen that the boat-house was just above Westminster Bridge;
it was afterwards moved to a point higher up the river.

Ely Place was the town mansion of the Bishops of Ely, dating
apparently from the time of John de Kirkeby, Bishop, who died 1290.
John of Gaunt died here. Sir Christopher Hatton got hold of part
of the garden, and built himself a house there, hence Hatton Garden.
In 1772 the see transferred to the Crown all its rights to Ely Place, a
house being built as an episcopal residence, now 37 Dover Street,
Piccadilly. The buildings, excepting St. Etheldreda’s Chapel, were
afterwards taken down. The Chapel, a fine piece of fourteenth-century
architecture, belongs to Roman Catholics.

William Marlow, who painted this picture, which has been engraved,

Scott and at the St. Martin’s Lane Academy, travelled in France and
Italy, and achieved some success as a landscape painter, exhibiting at
the Royal Academy and elsewhere, views of London being perhaps
his most successful work. Horace Walpole, in his note on Scott,
praises him highly. He died at Twickenham in 1813.

The following description of this interesting picture is culled
from the “Gentleman’s Magazine,” September 1836: “It represents
Ranelagh Grove, leading to Lord Ranelagh’s house and grounds,
Chelsea, so celebrated afterwards as a place of fashionable resort. In
the foreground are figures setting on two dogs to fight, painted in a
style which reminds one of the 'Stages of Cruelty.’ Behind is a
chariot richly ornamented with carving and gilding in the taste of
the time, containing a lady and gentleman drawn by two white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
horses. Another carriage is seen on the right proceeding towards
Chelsea through a lane lined with high trees. On the same side of
the picture is a village fair, with a number of figures, among which
may be recognized the fire-eater, seen in Hogarth’s 'Southwark
Fair.’ On the left a man strongly resembling Colonel Charteris, is
conducting a young lady attended by two maids, near whom is the
puzzling inscription: <span class="smcap">kee pont hiss ide</span> [keep on this side]. The
distance is a perspective view of a long row of trees with houses on
each side, to the present day called Ranelagh Grove.”
</p>

<p class="cat">
Richard Jones, first Earl of Ranelagh, built the house at Chelsea
known by his name in 1689-90, on land granted by lease from the
Crown. He had here a famous garden. The property was sold in
1733, and soon afterwards it became a place of entertainment.

In 1741 the Rotunda was built on the Ranelagh estate, being

most fashionable place of public resort, visited too by the leading
literary men, until the early part of the nineteenth century. Allusions
to it would fill a volume. On 30 September 1805 an order was made
for taking down Ranelagh House and the Rotunda, and the garden,
together with the sites of these buildings, was not long afterwards
added to the Royal Hospital grounds. Part of the Hospital may be
seen on spectator’s right; on the left is a glimpse of the river.

This painting, in which body colour has been used for the high
lights, is of much value as a topographical record. It is signed and
dated, and shows that old London Bridge was still being used for
traffic as late as the year 1830, when the new bridge was nearly
finished. It also gives their relative positions, and the nature of the
projecting starlings which had been added to break the rush of water
on the piers. At the end of new London Bridge is the church of
St. Michael, Crooked Lane, pulled down soon afterwards. The
first stone of the new bridge was laid 15 June 1825, and it was
publicly opened by William IV and Queen Adelaide 1 August
1831.

<p>
The furniture in this exhibition lent by the Secretary of State for
India, the Worshipful Companies of Carpenters, Stationers and
Clothworkers, and the Master of the Charterhouse, has been chosen as a
fitting accompaniment to the drawings and paintings of Old London.
They form a representative selection of such relics of London’s history as
have survived the vicissitudes of Time. A certain individuality stamps the
furniture. It was made for a definite reason, had a serious and official
purpose to fulfil, and thus differs in some respects from the contemporary
furniture of the home, in the making of which comfort, luxury, elegance
and other domestic requirements had to be considered. As would be
expected, therefore, the furniture from the India Office, from the City
Halls and from the Charterhouse, is essentially severe in character,
“masculine and unaffected,” and thoroughly sound both in design and
workmanship.
</p>

<p>
The largest and most important collection is that from the Secretary
of State for India. The India Office is fortunate in possessing a considerable
number of fine pieces of English furniture of the eighteenth
century. Most of these were transferred in the nineteenth century from
the “Old India House” in Leadenhall Street at the time when the India
Office absorbed the business of the East India Company. These historical
events are discussed in full detail in “Records of the Honourable East
India Company,” by Sir George Birdwood and William Foster.
</p>

<p>
A variety of interesting pieces have been lent by the Worshipful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
Companies of Carpenters, Stationers and Clothworkers. In the course
of their history the City Companies have suffered many misfortunes. Of
these the most disastrous was the Great Fire of 1666, which wrought
havoc with their Halls and historic possessions. Most of the Halls were
destroyed or suffered damage. Many were rebuilt under the influence of
Sir Christopher Wren and his successors, but in most cases have been
reconstructed in the nineteenth century. Fortunately, some of the panelling,
carvings and furniture have been preserved and incorporated in the
new buildings. The octagonal table in this exhibition, lent by the
Carpenters’ Company, is one of the few existing pieces earlier in date than
the Great Fire.
</p>

<p>
From the Charterhouse a few good pieces of English furniture have
been obtained. First a Carthusian monastery, afterwards a nobleman’s
palace, and lastly a Pensioners’ Hospital, the Charterhouse still shows
records of the different phases of its romantic history. The splendid
Elizabethan staircase and some of the panelling belong to the period
when the Duke of Norfolk occupied the building as a residence. Other
furniture and decoration commemorates the foundation of the hospital by
Thomas Sutton, a wealthy trader and philanthropist; worthy of special
mention is the small communion table in the chapel, bearing his arms
and a mutilated date (16—), perhaps the most distinguished piece of
furniture of its period which the country possesses. Unfortunately, it has
not been possible to secure this table for the present exhibition.
</p>

<p>
Much of the furniture, here exhibited, was lent to the exhibition at
Bethnal Green Museum organized by the Department of Science and
Art in 1896.
